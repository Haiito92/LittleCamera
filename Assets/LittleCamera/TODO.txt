Camera controller:
- Check that when computing average configuration, yaw value outside [0;360] don't create any problem. If so, normalize yaw in every view when calculating cameraconfig, or camera config returns normalized yaw too.

Utils:
- Make bezier function recursive.
- Make curve back to struct
